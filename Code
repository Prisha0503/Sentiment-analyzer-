import nltk
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# Download VADER Lexicon (only the first time)
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

# Initialize Sentiment Analyzer
sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Sample Sentences
sentences = [
    "I love working on machine learning projects!",
    "This internship application process is so stressful.",
    "Today was okay, nothing special.",
    "I’m feeling super productive and motivated!",
    "I’m not happy with the outcome."
]

# Analyze Sentiment
for sentence in sentences:
    scores = sia.polarity_scores(sentence)
    compound = scores['compound']
    sentiment = "Positive" if compound > 0.05 else "Negative" if compound < -0.05 else "Neutral"
    print(f"{sentence}\n→ Sentiment: {sentiment} (Score: {compound})\n")
